# Programming Assignments of CSE 486/586

### Overview

The goal of these Projects are to develop the skills of designing and implementing distributed protocols over multiple machines. 
They are more about designing and understanding the protocols/systems rather than programming.

Project 1 is a simple application of MapReduce. It familiarizes you with the Go language and the distributed coding environment. 

Project 2 works on a more complicated protocolâ€”distributed snapshot. It expects you to tackle more challenging designs. 

Project 3 and 4 implement Raft, a complex consensus protocol. It expects you to solve difficult problems in distributed systems.
